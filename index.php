			Hello! My name's Neeraj DeLima and I'm a young, aspiring software developer trying to disrupt
			the status quo. I have a certain curiosity about most things in the universe, from astronomy to
			politics, and I learn a lot every day from the things that I do and the people around me. I'm 
			constantly trying to develop myself — intellectually, physically and socially — because I
			believe that is the only path to success.

			Hello! My name's Neeraj DeLima and I'm a young, aspiring software developer, entrepreneur and dreamer whose
			aim in life is to disrupt the status quo. I grew up in Mumbai, India but my experiences and good fortune have taken me
			far away, to Atlanta, GA where I'm currently based. I have a certain curiosity about most things in the universe, from
			astronomy to politics, which is something I cherish. I'm not one to turn down an opportunity to learn something new, no
			matter what it is.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm enrolled at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying Computer Science, and expected to graduate in 2018.
			My hobbies include playing and following sports, learning Mandarin Chinese, teaching myself jazz piano and attempting
			to watch every film made between 1967 and 1975. I'm a huge fan of the Atlanta Hawks and Georgia Tech basketball.
