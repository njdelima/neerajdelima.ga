<p>This is probably the project I’m most proud of, by a long shot.</p>

<p>Summer of 2015, my roommate made the startling,  but not entirely unbelievable discovery that professional grade server computers are actually NOT prohibitively expensive – just have a look at <a href=“http://www.ebay.com/sch/Enterprise-Network-Servers/11211/bn_886971/i.html?_trksid=p2045573.m4213”>this</a>. Since we were both reasonably well versed in Linux and system administration, we decided to split the cost and buy one and life hasn’t been the same since.</p>

<p>We decided to set it up as a <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor#Classification”>bare-metal hypervisor</a> – it has 72GB of RAM to go around -and loaded <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment”>Proxmox Virtual Environment</a> on there to manage VMs. Though Georgia Tech’s internet is top class, they only provide us with a single public IP address so we have to use 10.0.0.0/8 <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network”>private address space</a> and <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation#DNAT”>DNAT</a>for any outward facing services.</p>

<p>I can’t even describe how useful this little thing has been, both professionally and personally. Any time I want a new website up, I just make a new VM, load up<a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx”>nginx</a> and boom. It’s online. Anytime I or a friend needs a backend for any type of application, I can just make a new database on our MySQL server. Hell, we even have our own Minecraft server running on there - not to mention the 4TB of cloud storage it provides.</p>

<p>To sum it up, this thing was the definition of a good purchase</p>
